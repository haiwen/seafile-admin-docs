The username will be passed to SeaHub for a successful auto login.</li> <li>If the WinHttp API failed to get a ticket, it will then try the NTLM protocol by sending an HTTP request with Negotiate NTLMSSP token in the header.

LDAP_GROUP_OBJECT_CLASS This is the name of the class used to search for group objects. LDAP_GROUP_MEMBER_ATTR The attribute field to use when loading the group's members. For most directory servers, the attribute is \"member\" which is the default value. For \"posixGroup\", it should be set to \"memberUid\". LDAP_USER_ATTR_IN_MEMBERUID The user attribute set in 'memberUid' option, which is used in \"posixGroup\". The default value is \"uid\". LDAP_GROUP_UUID_ATTR Used to uniquely identify groups in LDAP. LDAP_GROUP_FILTER An additional filter to use when searching group objects. If it's set, the final filter used to run search is <code>(&amp;(objectClass=GROUP_OBJECT_CLASS)(GROUP_FILTER))</code>; otherwise the final filter would be <code>(objectClass=GROUP_OBJECT_CLASS)</code>. LDAP_USER_GROUP_MEMBER_RANGE_QUERY When a group contains too many members, AD will only return part of them. Set this option to TRUE to make LDAP sync work with large groups. DEL_GROUP_IF_NOT_FOUND Set to \"true\", sync process will delete the group if not found in the LDAP server. LDAP_SYNC_GROUP_AS_DEPARTMENT Whether to sync groups as top-level departments in Seafile. Learn more about departments in Seafile here. LDAP_DEPT_NAME_ATTR Used to get the department name. <p>Tip</p> <ul> <li> <p>The search base for groups is the option <code>LDAP_BASE_DN</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some LDAP server, such as Active Directory, allows a group to be a member of another group. This is called \"group nesting\". If we find a nested group B in group A, we should recursively add all the members from group B into group A. And group B should still be imported a separate group. That is, all members of group B are also members in group A.</p> </li> <li> <p>In some LDAP server, such as OpenLDAP, it's common practice to use Posix groups to store group membership. To import Posix groups as Seafile groups, set <code>LDAP_GROUP_OBJECT_CLASS</code> option to <code>posixGroup</code>. A <code>posixGroup</code> object in LDAP usually contains a multi-value attribute for the list of member UIDs. The name of this attribute can be set with the <code>LDAP_GROUP_MEMBER_ATTR</code> option. It's <code>MemberUid</code> by default. The value of the <code>MemberUid</code> attribute is an ID that can be used to identify a user, which corresponds to an attribute in the user object. The name of this ID attribute is usually <code>uid</code>, but can be set via the <code>LDAP_USER_ATTR_IN_MEMBERUID</code> option.

These two options are added to prevent long fs-id-list requests from overloading the server.</p> <p>Since Pro 8.0.4 version, you can set both options to -1, to allow unlimited size and timeout.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>This configuration is only effective for downloading files through web page or API, but not for syncing files</p> <pre><code>[fileserver]\nmax_sync_file_count = 100000\nfs_id_list_request_timeout = 300\n</code></pre> <p>If you use object storage as storage backend, when a large file is frequently downloaded, the same blocks need to be fetched from the storage backend to Seafile server. This may waste bandwith and cause high load on the internal network. Since Seafile Pro 8.0.5 version, we add block caching to improve the situation. </p> <ul> <li>To enable this feature, set <code>use_block_cache</code> option in the <code>[fileserver]</code> group. It's not enabled by default. </li> <li>The <code>block_cache_size_limit</code> option is used to limit the size of the cache. Its default value is 10GB. The blocks are cached in <code>seafile-data/block-cache</code> directory. When the total size of cached files exceeds the limit, seaf-server will clean up older files until the size reduces to 70% of the limit. The cleanup interval is 5 minutes. You have to have a good estimate on how much space you need for the cache directory. Otherwise on frequent downloads this directory can be quickly filled up.</li> <li>The <code>block_cache_file_types</code> configuration is used to choose the file types that are cached. <code>block_cache_file_types</code> the default value is mp4;mov.</li> </ul> <p><pre><code>[fileserver]\nuse_block_cache = true\n# Set block cache size limit to 100MB\nblock_cache_size_limit = 100\nblock_cache_file_types = mp4;mov\n</code></pre> When a large number of files are uploaded through the web page and API, it will be expensive to calculate block IDs based on the block contents. Since Seafile-pro-9.0.6, you can add the <code>skip_block_hash</code> option to use a random string as block ID.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>This option will prevent fsck from checking block content integrity. You should specify <code>--shallow</code> option to fsck to not check content integrity.</p> <pre><code>[fileserver]\nskip_block_hash = true\n</code></pre> <p>If you want to limit the type of files when uploading files, since Seafile Pro 10.0.0 version, you can set <code>file_ext_white_list</code> option in the <code>[fileserver]</code> group.

To enable it, you can set the options below in seafile.conf:</p> <pre><code>[fileserver]\nuse_go_fileserver = true\n</code></pre> <p>Go fileserver has 3 advantages over the traditional fileserver implemented in C language:</p> <ol> <li>Better performance when syncing libraries with large number of files. With C fileserver, syncing large libraries may consume all the worker threads in the server and make the service slow. There is a config option <code>max_sync_file_count</code> to limit the size of library to be synced. The default is 100K. With Go fileserver you can set this option to a much higher number, such as 1 million.</li> <li>Downloading zipped folders on the fly. And there is no limit on the size of the downloaded folder. With C fileserver, the server has to first create a zip file for the downloaded folder then send it to the client. With Go fileserver, the zip file can be created while transferring to the client. The option <code>max_download_dir_size</code> is thus no longer needed by Go fileserver.</li> <li>Since version 10.0 you can also set upload/download rate limits.</li> </ol> <p>Go fileserver caches fs objects in memory. On the one hand, it avoids repeated creation and destruction of repeatedly accessed objects; on the other hand it will also slow down the speed at which objects are released, which will prevent go's gc mechanism from consuming too much CPU time.

Seafile supports authentication via Shibboleth. It allows users from another organization to log in to Seafile without registering an account on the service provider.</p> <p>In this documentation, we assume the reader is familiar with Shibboleth installation and configuration. For introduction to Shibboleth concepts, please refer to https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CONCEPT/overview .</p> <p>Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) should be installed on the same server as the Seafile server. The official SP from https://shibboleth.net/ is implemented as an Apache module. The module handles all Shibboleth authentication details. Seafile server receives authentication information (username) from HTTP request. The username then can be used as login name for the user.</p> <p>Seahub provides a special URL to handle Shibboleth login. The URL is <code>https://your-seafile-domain/sso</code>. Only this URL needs to be configured under Shibboleth protection. All other URLs don't go through the Shibboleth module. The overall workflow for a user to login with Shibboleth is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>In the Seafile login page, there is a separate \"Single Sign-On\" login button. When the user clicks the button, she/he will be redirected to <code>https://your-seafile-domain/sso</code>.</li> <li>Since that URL is controlled by Shibboleth, the user will be redirected to IdP for login. After the user logs in, she/he will be redirected back to <code>https://your-seafile-domain/sso</code>.</li> <li>This time the Shibboleth module passes the request to Seahub. Seahub reads the user information from the request(<code>HTTP_REMOTE_USER</code> header)  and brings the user to her/his home page.</li> <li>All later access to Seahub will not pass through the Shibboleth module. Since Seahub keeps session information internally, the user doesn't need to login again until the session expires.</li> </ol> <p>Since Shibboleth support requires Apache, if you want to use Nginx, you need two servers, one for non-Shibboleth access, another configured with Apache to allow Shibboleth login.

Otherwise sometimes folder download on the web UI can't work properly. Read the \"Load Balancer Setting\" section below for details</p>"},{"location":"setup_binary/deploy_in_a_cluster/#architecture","title":"Architecture","text":"<p>The Seafile cluster solution employs a 3-tier architecture:</p> <ul> <li>Load balancer tier: Distribute incoming traffic to Seafile servers. HA can be achieved by deploying multiple load balancer instances.</li> <li>Seafile server cluster: a cluster of Seafile server instances. If one instance fails, the load balancer will stop handing traffic to it. So HA is achieved.</li> <li>Backend storage: Distributed storage cluster, e.g.  S3, Openstack Swift or Ceph.</li> </ul> <p>This architecture scales horizontally. That means, you can handle more traffic by adding more machines. The architecture is visualized in the following picture.</p> <p></p> <p>There are two main components on the Seafile server node: web server (Nginx/Apache) and Seafile app server. The web server passes requests from the clients to Seafile app server. The Seafile app servers work independently. They don't know about each other's state. That means each app server can fail independently without affecting other app server instances. The load balancer is responsible for detecting failure and re-routing requests.</p> <p>Even though Seafile app servers work independently, they still have to share some session information. All shared session information is stored in memory cache. Thus, all Seafile app servers have to connect to the same memory cache server (cluster). Since Pro Edition 11.0, both memcached and Redis can be used as memory cache. Before 11.0, only memcached is supported. More details about memory cache configuration is available later.</p> <p>The background server is the workhorse for various background tasks, including full-text indexing, office file preview, virus scanning, LDAP syncing. It should usually be run on a dedicated server for better performance. Currently only one background task server can be running in the entire cluster. If more than one background servers are running, they may conflict with each others when doing some tasks. If you need HA for background task server, you can consider using Keepalived to build a hot backup for it. More details can be found in background server setup.</p> <p>All Seafile app servers access the same set of user data. The user data has two parts: One in the MySQL database and the other one in the backend storage cluster (S3, Ceph etc.). All app servers serve the data equally to the clients.</p> <p>All app servers have to connect to the same database or database cluster. We recommend to use MariaDB Galera Cluster if you need a database cluster.</p> <p>There are a few steps to deploy a Seafile cluster:</p> <ol> <li>Prepare hardware, operating systems, memory cache and database</li> <li>Setup a single Seafile server node</li> <li>Copy the deployment to other Seafile nodes</li> <li>Setup Nginx/Apache and firewall rules</li> <li>Setup load balancer</li> <li>Setup backgroup task node</li> </ol>"},{"location":"setup_binary/deploy_in_a_cluster/#preparation","title":"Preparation","text":""},{"location":"setup_binary/deploy_in_a_cluster/#hardware-database-memory-cache","title":"Hardware, Database, Memory Cache","text":"<p>At least 3 Linux server with at least 4 cores, 8GB RAM.

For larger clusters, you can have 3 more dedicated server to run memcached cluster and MariaDB cluster. Because the load on these two clusters are not high, they can share the hardware to save cost. Documentation about how to setup memcached cluster and MariaDB cluster can be found here.</p> <p>Since version 11.0, Redis can also be used as memory cache server.

Here we'll provide a tutorial about how and what to share.</p> <p>How to setup nfs server and client is beyond the scope of this wiki.

And supposed you mount the NFS drive on <code>/seafile-nfs</code>, you should follow a few steps:</p> <ul> <li>Move the <code>seafile-data</code> and <code>seahub-data</code> folder to <code>/seafile-nfs</code>:</li> </ul> <pre><code>mv /data/haiwen/seafile-data /seafile-nfs/\nmv /data/haiwen/seahub-data /seafile-nfs/\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>On every node in the cluster, make a symbolic link to the shared <code>seafile-data</code> and <code>seahub-data</code> folder </li> </ul> <pre><code>cd /data/haiwen\nln -s /seafile-nfs/seafile-data /data/haiwen/seafile-data\nln -s /seafile-nfs/seahub-data /data/haiwen/seahub-data\n</code></pre> <p>This way the instances will share the same <code>seafile-data</code> and <code>seahub-data</code> folder.

Because there is no buttom bar in the navigation side bar now.</li> <li>For binary package based installation, a new <code>.env</code> file is needed to contain some configuration items. These configuration items need to be shared by different components in Seafile. We name it <code>.env</code> to be consistant with docker based installation.</li> <li>[File tags] The current file tags feature is deprecated.
