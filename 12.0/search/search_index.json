We call this procedure \"indexing\". By default, the file server uses 1 thread to sequentially index the file and store the blocks one by one. This is suitable for most cases. But if you're using S3/Ceph/Swift backends, you may have more bandwidth in the storage backend for storing multiple blocks in parallel. We provide an option to define the number of concurrent threads in indexing:</p> <pre><code>[fileserver]\nmax_indexing_threads = 10\n</code></pre> <p>When users upload files in the web interface (seahub), file server divides the file into fixed size blocks.

The default is 100000. When you download a repo, Seafile client will request fs id list, and you can control the timeout period of this request through <code>fs_id_list_request_timeout</code> configuration, which defaults to 5 minutes. These two options are added to prevent long fs-id-list requests from overloading the server.</p> <p>Since Pro 8.0.4 version, you can set both options to -1, to allow unlimited size and timeout.</p> <pre><code>[fileserver]\nmax_sync_file_count = 100000\nfs_id_list_request_timeout = 300\n</code></pre> <p>If you use object storage as storage backend, when a large file is frequently downloaded, the same blocks need to be fetched from the storage backend to Seafile server. This may waste bandwith and cause high load on the internal network.

It's not enabled by default. </li> <li>The <code>block_cache_size_limit</code> option is used to limit the size of the cache. Its default value is 10GB. The blocks are cached in <code>seafile-data/block-cache</code> directory. When the total size of cached files exceeds the limit, seaf-server will clean up older files until the size reduces to 70% of the limit. The cleanup interval is 5 minutes. You have to have a good estimate on how much space you need for the cache directory. Otherwise on frequent downloads this directory can be quickly filled up.</li> <li>The <code>block_cache_file_types</code> configuration is used to choose the file types that are cached. <code>block_cache_file_types</code> the default value is mp4;mov.</li> </ul> <p><pre><code>[fileserver]\nuse_block_cache = true\n# Set block cache size limit to 100MB\nblock_cache_size_limit = 100\nblock_cache_file_types = mp4;mov\n</code></pre> When a large number of files are uploaded through the web page and API, it will be expensive to calculate block IDs based on the block contents.

Seafile supports authentication via Shibboleth. It allows users from another organization to log in to Seafile without registering an account on the service provider.</p> <p>In this documentation, we assume the reader is familiar with Shibboleth installation and configuration. For introduction to Shibboleth concepts, please refer to https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CONCEPT/overview .</p> <p>Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) should be installed on the same server as the Seafile server. The official SP from https://shibboleth.net/ is implemented as an Apache module. The module handles all Shibboleth authentication details. Seafile server receives authentication information (username) from HTTP request. The username then can be used as login name for the user.</p> <p>Seahub provides a special URL to handle Shibboleth login. The URL is <code>https://your-seafile-domain/sso</code>. Only this URL needs to be configured under Shibboleth protection. All other URLs don't go through the Shibboleth module. The overall workflow for a user to login with Shibboleth is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>In the Seafile login page, there is a separate \"Single Sign-On\" login button. When the user clicks the button, she/he will be redirected to <code>https://your-seafile-domain/sso</code>.</li> <li>Since that URL is controlled by Shibboleth, the user will be redirected to IdP for login. After the user logs in, she/he will be redirected back to <code>https://your-seafile-domain/sso</code>.</li> <li>This time the Shibboleth module passes the request to Seahub. Seahub reads the user information from the request(<code>HTTP_REMOTE_USER</code> header)  and brings the user to her/his home page.</li> <li>All later access to Seahub will not pass through the Shibboleth module. Since Seahub keeps session information internally, the user doesn't need to login again until the session expires.</li> </ol> <p>Since Shibboleth support requires Apache, if you want to use Nginx, you need two servers, one for non-Shibboleth access, another configured with Apache to allow Shibboleth login. In a cluster environment, you can configure your load balancer to direct traffic to different server according to URL. Only the URL <code>https://your-seafile-domain/sso</code> needs to be directed to Apache.</p> <p>The configuration includes 3 steps:</p> <ol> <li>Install and configure Shibboleth Service Provider;</li> <li>Configure Apache;</li> <li>Configure Seahub.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"config/shibboleth_authentication/#install-and-configure-shibboleth-service-provider","title":"Install and Configure Shibboleth Service Provider","text":"<p>We use CentOS 7 as example.</p>"},{"location":"config/shibboleth_authentication/#configure-apache","title":"Configure Apache","text":"<p>You should create a new virtual host configuration for Shibboleth.

HA can be achieved by deploying multiple load balancer instances.</li> <li>Seafile server cluster: a cluster of Seafile server instances. If one instance fails, the load balancer will stop handing traffic to it. So HA is achieved.</li> <li>Backend storage: Distributed storage cluster, e.g.  S3, Openstack Swift or Ceph.</li> </ul> <p>This architecture scales horizontally. That means, you can handle more traffic by adding more machines. The architecture is visualized in the following picture.</p> <p></p> <p>There are two main components on the Seafile server node: web server (Nginx/Apache) and Seafile app server. The web server passes requests from the clients to Seafile app server. The Seafile app servers work independently. They don't know about each other's state. That means each app server can fail independently without affecting other app server instances. The load balancer is responsible for detecting failure and re-routing requests.</p> <p>Even though Seafile app servers work independently, they still have to share some session information. All shared session information is stored in memory cache. Thus, all Seafile app servers have to connect to the same memory cache server (cluster). Since Pro Edition 11.0, both memcached and Redis can be used as memory cache. Before 11.0, only memcached is supported. More details about memory cache configuration is available later.</p> <p>The background server is the workhorse for various background tasks, including full-text indexing, office file preview, virus scanning, LDAP syncing. It should usually be run on a dedicated server for better performance. Currently only one background task server can be running in the entire cluster. If more than one background servers are running, they may conflict with each others when doing some tasks. If you need HA for background task server, you can consider using Keepalived to build a hot backup for it.</p> <p>In the seafile cluster, only one server should run the background tasks, including:</p> <ul> <li>indexing files for search</li> <li>email notification</li> <li>LDAP sync</li> <li>virus scan</li> </ul> <p>Let's assume you have three nodes in your cluster: A, B, and C.</p> <ul> <li>Node A is backend node that run background tasks.</li> <li>Node B and C are frontend nodes that serving requests from clients.</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"setup/cluster_deploy_with_docker/#cluster-requirements","title":"Cluster requirements","text":"<p>Please refer here for the details about the cluster requirements for all nodes in Seafile cluster.

For the configurations for each backend section, please refer to the following table:</p> Variable Description <code>bucket</code> Bucket name for commit, fs, and block objects. Make sure it follows S3 naming rules (you can refer the notes below the table). <code>key_id</code> The <code>key_id</code> is required to authenticate you to S3. You can find the <code>key_id</code> in the \"security credentials\" section on your AWS account page or from your storage provider. <code>key</code> The <code>key</code> is required to authenticate you to S3. You can find the <code>key</code> in the \"security credentials\" section on your AWS account page or from your storage provider. <code>use_v4_signature</code> There are two versions of authentication protocols that can be used with S3 storage: Version 2 (older, may still be supported by some regions) and Version 4 (current, used by most regions). If you don't set this option, Seafile will use the v2 protocol. It's suggested to use the v4 protocol. <code>use_https</code> Use https to connect to S3. It's recommended to use https. <code>aws_region</code> (Optional) If you use the v4 protocol and AWS S3, set this option to the region you chose when you create the buckets. If it's not set and you're using the v4 protocol, Seafile will use <code>us-east-1</code> as the default. This option will be ignored if you use the v2 protocol. <code>host</code> (Optional) The endpoint by which you access the storage service. Usually it starts with the region name. It's required to provide the host address if you use storage provider other than AWS, otherwise Seafile will use AWS's address (i.e., <code>s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code>). <code>sse_c_key</code> (Optional) A string of 32 characters can be generated by <code>openssl rand -base64 24</code>. It can be any 32-character long random string. It's required to use V4 authentication protocol and https if you enable SSE-C. <code>path_style_request</code> (Optional) This option asks Seafile to use URLs like <code>https://192.168.1.123:8080/bucketname/object</code> to access objects. In Amazon S3, the default URL format is in virtual host style, such as <code>https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/object</code>. But this style relies on advanced DNS server setup. So most self-hosted storage systems only implement the path style format. So we recommend to set this option to true for self-hosted storage. <p>Bucket naming conventions</p> <p>No matter if you using AWS or any other S3 compatible object storage, we recommend that you follow S3 naming rules. When you create buckets on S3, please read the S3 rules for naming first.

In the old version, deleted files are scanned from library history, which is slow.</li> <li>Community edition now also support online GC (because SQLite support is dropped)</li> </ul> <p>Configuration changes:</p> <ul> <li>Notification server is now packaged into its own docker image.</li> <li>For binary package based installation, a new <code>.env</code> file is needed to contain some configuration items. These configuration items need to be shared by different components in Seafile. We name it <code>.env</code> to be consistant with docker based installation.</li> <li>The password strength level is now calculated by algorithm. The old USER_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH, USER_PASSWORD_STRENGTH_LEVEL is removed. Only USER_STRONG_PASSWORD_REQUIRED is still used.</li> <li>ADDITIONAL_APP_BOTTOM_LINKS is removed. Because there is no buttom bar in the navigation side bar now.</li> <li>SERVICE_URL and FILE_SERVER_ROOT are removed. SERVICE_URL will be calculated from SEAFILE_SERVER_PROTOCOL and SEAFILE_SERVER_HOSTNAME in <code>.env</code> file.</li> <li><code>ccnet.conf</code> is removed. Some of its configuration items are moved from <code>.env</code> file, others are read from items in <code>seafile.conf</code> with same name.</li> <li>Two role permissions are added, <code>can_create_wiki</code> and <code>can_publish_wiki</code> are used to control whether a role can create a Wiki and publish a Wiki.
