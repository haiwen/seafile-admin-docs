# Notification Server Overview

Currently, the status updates of files and libraries on the client and web interface are based on polling the server. The latest status cannot be reflected in real time on the client due to polling delays. The client needs to periodically refresh the library modification, file locking, subdirectory permissions and other information, which causes additional performance overhead to the server.

When a directory is opened on the web interface, the lock status of the file cannot be updated in real time, and the page needs to be refreshed.

The notification server uses websocket protocol and maintains a two-way communication connection with the client or the web interface. When the above changes occur, seaf-server will notify the notification server of the changes. Then the notification server can notify the client or the web interface in real time. This not only improves the real-time performance, but also reduces the performance overhead of the server.

## Supported update reminder types

1. The library has been updated.
2. File lock status changes under the library.
3. Directory permission changes under the library.

## How to configure and run

Since Seafile 12.0, we use a separate Docker image to deploy the notification server. First download `notification-server.yml` to Seafile directory:

```sh
wget https://manual.seafile.com/13.0/repo/docker/notification-server.yml
```

Modify `.env`, and insert `notification-server.yml` into `COMPOSE_FILE`:

```env
COMPOSE_FILE='seafile-server.yml,caddy.yml,notification-server.yml'
```

then add or modify `ENABLE_NOTIFICATION_SERVER`:

```sh
ENABLE_NOTIFICATION_SERVER=true
```

Finally, You can run notification server with the following command:

```sh
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

## Checking notification server status

When the notification server is working, you can access `http://127.0.0.1:8083/ping` from your browser, which will answer `{"ret": "pong"}`. If you have a proxy configured, you can access `https://seafile.example.com/notification/ping` from your browser instead.

## Compatible client

1. Seadrive 3.0.1 or later.
2. Seafile client 8.0.11 or later.

If the client works with notification server, there should be a log message in seafile.log or seadrive.log.

```
Notification server is enabled on the remote server xxxx
```

## Notification Server in Seafile cluster

There is no additional features for notification server in the Pro Edition. It works the same as in community edition.

If you enable [clustering](../setup_binary/cluster_deployment.md), You need to deploy notification server on one of the servers, or a separate server. The load balancer should forward websockets requests to this node.

Download `.env` and `notification-server.yml` to notification server directory:

```sh
wget https://manual.seafile.com/13.0/repo/docker/notification-server/notification-server.yml
wget -O .env https://manual.seafile.com/13.0/repo/docker/notification-server/env
```

Then modify the `.env` file according to your environment. The following fields are needed to be modified:

| variable               | description                                                                                                   |  
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| `SEAFILE_MYSQL_DB_HOST`| Seafile MySQL host                                                                                            |  
| `SEAFILE_MYSQL_DB_USER`| Seafile MySQL user, default is `seafile`                                                                       |  
| `SEAFILE_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD`| Seafile MySQL password                                                                                    |  
| `TIME_ZONE`            | Time zone                                                                                                     |  
| `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`      | JWT key, the same as the config in Seafile `.env` file                                                         |  
| `SEAFILE_SERVER_HOSTNAME`| Seafile host name                                                                                           |  
| `SEAFILE_SERVER_PROTOCOL`| http or https                                                                                               |  

Now, you can run notification server with the following command:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

then you need to modify the **`.env` on the host deployed Seafile**:

```sh
ENABLE_NOTIFICATION_SERVER=true
NOTIFICATION_SERVER_URL=http://<your notification server host>:8083
INNER_NOTIFICATION_SERVER_URL=$NOTIFICATION_SERVER_URL
```

!!! tip "Difference between `NOTIFICATION_SERVER_URL` and `INNER_NOTIFICATION_SERVER_URL`"
    - `NOTIFICATION_SERVER_URL`: used to do the connection between client (i.e., user's browser) and notification server
    - `INNER_NOTIFICATION_SERVER_URL`: used to do the connection between Seafile server and notification server

Finally, you need to configure load balancer according to the following forwarding rules:

1. Forward `/notification/ping` requests to notification server via http protocol.
2. Forward websockets requests with URL prefix `/notification` to notification server.

Here is a configuration that uses haproxy to support notification server. Haproxy version needs to be >= 2.0.
You should use similar configurations for other load balancers.

```
