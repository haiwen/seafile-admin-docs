# Seafile AI extension

From Seafile 13 Pro, users can enable ***Seafile AI*** to support the following features:

- File tags, file and image summaries, text translation, sdoc writing assistance
- Given an image, generate its corresponding tags (including objects, weather, color, etc.)
- Detect faces in images and encode them
- Detect text locations in images and recognize them

## Deploy Seafile AI basic service

The Seafile AI basic service will use API calls to external large language model service (e.g., *GPT-4o-mini*) to implement file labeling, file and image summaries, text translation, and sdoc writing assistance.

1. Download `seafile-ai.yml`

    ```sh
    wget https://manual.seafile.com/13.0/repo/docker/seafile-ai.yml
    ```

    !!! note "Deploy in a cluster"

        If you deploy Seafile in a cluster and would like to deploy Seafile AI, please expose port `8888` in `seafile-ai.yml`:

        ```yml
        services:
          seafile-ai:
            ...
            ports:
              - 8888:8888
        ```

        At the same time, Seafile AI should be deployed on one of the cluster nodes.

2. Modify `.env`, insert or modify the following fields:

    ```
    COMPOSE_FILE='...,seafile-ai.yml' # add seafile-ai.yml

    ENABLE_SEAFILE_AI=true
    SEAFILE_AI_LLM_TYPE=open-ai
    SEAFILE_AI_LLM_URL=<your LLM endpoint URL>
    SEAFILE_AI_LLM_KEY=<your LLM access key>
    ```

    !!! note "Deploy in a cluster"
        Please also specify `SEAFILE_AI_SERVER_URL` to the host where deploys your Seafile AI basic service in `.env`, if you deploy Seafile in a cluster.

3. Restart Seafile server:

    ```sh
    docker compose down
    docker compose up -d
    ```

!!! tip
    Since the file tagging feature requires [deploying the metadata service](./metadata-server.md) first, the file tagging feature is not enabled by default. You can enable this feature in the repo's settings after enabling extension properties (see the figure below, it will only be enabled if you have management permissions for this repo).
