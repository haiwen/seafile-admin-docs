# Single Sign On support in Seafile

Seafile supports most of the popular single-sign-on authentication protocols. Some are included in Community Edition, some are only in Pro Edition.

In the Community Edition:

* [Shibboleth](./shibboleth_config_v6.3.md)
* [OAuth](./oauth.md)
* [Remote User (Proxy Server)](./remote_user.md)

Kerberos authentication can be integrated by using Apache as a proxy server and follow the instructions in [Remote User Authentication](./remote_user.md).

In Pro Edition:

* [ADFS or SAML 2.0](../deploy_pro/adfs.md)
* [CAS](../deploy_pro/cas.md)
