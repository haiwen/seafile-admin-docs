# Deploying Seafile with MySQL

This manual explains how to setup and run Seafile server from a pre-built package with MySQL.

**Tip:** If you are deploying the Seafile service for the first time, we recommend that you use an [automatic installation script](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile-server-installer) to quickly deploy a Seafile service.

## Download

[Download](https://www.seafile.com/en/download) the latest server package.

## Deploying and Directory Layout

Supposed you have downloaded `seafile-server_*`  into `/opt/seafile/`. We suggest you to use the following layout for your deployment:

```
mkdir /opt/seafile
mv seafile-server_* /opt/seafile
cd /opt/seafile
# after moving seafile-server_* to this directory
tar -xzf seafile-server_*
mkdir installed
mv seafile-server_* installed

```

Now you should have the following directory layout

```
#tree seafile -L 2
seafile
├── installed
│   └── seafile-server_7.0.0_x86-64.tar.gz
└── seafile-server-7.0.0
    ├── reset-admin.sh
    ├── runtime
    ├── seafile
    ├── seafile.sh
    ├── seahub
    ├── seahub.sh
    ├── setup-seafile-mysql.sh
    └── upgrade

```

The benefit of this layout is that:

* We can place all the config files for Seafile server inside  `/opt/seafile/conf` directory, making it easier to manage.
* When you upgrade to a new version of Seafile, you can simply untar the latest package into  `/opt/seafile` directory. In this way you can reuse the existing config files in  `/opt/seafile`  directory and don't need to configure again.

## Prepare MySQL Databases

Three components of Seafile Server need their own databases:

* ccnet server
* seafile server
* seahub

See [Seafile Server Components Overview](../overview/components.md) if you want to know more about the Seafile server components.

There are two ways to intialize the databases:

* let the `setup-seafile-mysql.sh` script create the databases for you.
* create the databases by yourself, or someone else (the database admin, for example)

We recommend the first way. The script would ask you for the root password of the mysql server, and it will create:

* database for ccnet/seafile/seahub.
* a new user to access these databases

However, sometimes you have to use the second way. If you don't have the root password, you need someone who has the privileges, e.g., the database admin, to create the three databases, as well as a mysql user who can access the three databases for you. For example, to create three databases: `ccnet_db` / `seafile_db` / `seahub_db` for ccnet/seafile/seahub respectively, and a mysql user "seafile" to access these databases run the following SQL queries:

```
create database `ccnet_db` character set = 'utf8';
create database `seafile_db` character set = 'utf8';
create database `seahub_db` character set = 'utf8';

create user 'seafile'@'localhost' identified by 'seafile';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `ccnet_db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `seafile_db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `seahub_db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;

```

## Setting Up Seafile Server

### Prerequisites

The Seafile server package requires the following packages to be installed on your system:

**For Seafile 7.0.x**

```
# on Ubuntu 16.04
apt-get update
apt-get install python2.7 python-setuptools python-mysqldb python-urllib3 python-ldap -y

```

```
# on CentOS 7
yum install python python-setuptools MySQL-python python-urllib3 python-ldap -y

```

**For Seafile 7.1.x**

```
# on Debian 10/Ubuntu 18.04
apt-get update
apt-get install python3 python3-setuptools python3-pip -y

pip3 install --timeout=3600 Pillow pylibmc captcha jinja2 sqlalchemy==1.3.8 \
    django-pylibmc django-simple-captcha python3-ldap

```

```
# on CentOS 8
yum install python3 python3-setuptools python3-pip -y

pip3 install --timeout=3600 Pillow pylibmc captcha jinja2 sqlalchemy==1.3.8 \
    django-pylibmc django-simple-captcha python3-ldap

```

### Setup

```
cd seafile-server-*
./setup-seafile-mysql.sh  # run the setup script & answer prompted questions

```

If some of the prerequisites are not installed, the Seafile initialization script will ask you to install them.

The script will guide you through the settings of various configuration options.

** Seafile configuration options **

| Option              | Description                                                                                      | Note                                                                                                                                        |

| seafile data dir    | Seafile stores your data in this directory. By default it'll be placed in the current directory. | The size of this directory will increase as you put more and more data into Seafile. Please select a disk partition with enough free space. |
| fileserver port     | The TCP port used by Seafile fileserver                                                          | Default is 8082. If it's been used by other service, you can set it to another port.                                                        |

At this moment, you will be asked to choose a way to initialize Seafile databases:

```sh
-------------------------------------------------------
Please choose a way to initialize Seafile databases:
-------------------------------------------------------

[1] Create new ccnet/seafile/seahub databases
[2] Use existing ccnet/seafile/seahub databases

```

Which one to choose depends on if you have the root password.

* If you choose "1", you need to provide the root password. The script would create the databases and a new user to access the databases
* If you choose "2", the ccnet/seafile/seahub databases must have already been created, either by you, or someone else.

If you choose "\[1] Create new ccnet/seafile/seahub databases", you would be asked these questions:

If the setup is successful, you'll see the following output

![server-setup-succesfully](../images/Server-setup-successfully.png)

Now you should have the following directory layout :

```sh
#tree seafile -L 2
seafile
├── ccnet               # configuration files
│   ├── mykey.peer
│   ├── PeerMgr
│   └── seafile.ini
├── conf
│   └── ccnet.conf
│   └── seafile.conf
│   └── seahub_settings.py
│   └── gunicorn.conf
├── installed
│   └── seafile-server_7.0.0_x86-64.tar.gz
├── seafile-data
├── seafile-server-7.0.0  # active version
│   ├── reset-admin.sh
│   ├── runtime
│   ├── seafile
│   ├── seafile.sh
│   ├── seahub
│   ├── seahub.sh
│   ├── setup-seafile-mysql.sh
│   └── upgrade
├── seafile-server-latest  # symbolic link to seafile-server-7.0.0
├── seahub-data
│   └── avatars

```

The folder `seafile-server-latest` is a symbolic link to the current Seafile server folder. When later you upgrade to a new version, the upgrade scripts update this link to point to the latest Seafile Server folder.

## Running Seafile Server

### Starting Seafile Server and Seahub Website

Under seafile-server-latest directory, run the following commands

```
./seafile.sh start # Start Seafile service
./seahub.sh start  # Start seahub website, port defaults to 127.0.0.1:8000

```

The first time you start Seahub, the script would prompt you to create an admin account for your Seafile Server.

**Note:** The Seahub service listens on `127.0.0.1:8000` by default. So we recommend that you deploy a reverse proxy service so that other users can access the Seahub service.

### Deploy a reverse proxy service

You can choose [Apache](deploy_with_apache.md) or [Nginx](deploy_with_nginx.md) as the reverse proxy service.

After deployed the reverse proxy service, you may open a web browser and visit Seafile web interface at (assume your server IP is 192.168.1.111):

```
http://192.168.1.111/

```

Congratulations! Now you have successfully setup your private Seafile Server.

### Run Seahub on another port

If you want to run Seahub on a port other than the default 8000, say 8001, you must modify the `conf/gunicorn.conf`:

```
# default localhost:8000
bind = "0.0.0.0:8001"

```

Then restart Seafile service:

```
./seafile.sh restart
./seahub.sh restart

```

## Stopping and Restarting Seafile and Seahub

### Stopping

```
./seahub.sh stop # stop Seahub website
./seafile.sh stop # stop Seafile processes

```

### Restarting

```
./seafile.sh restart
./seahub.sh restart

```

### When the Scripts Fail

Most of the time, seafile.sh and seahub.sh work fine. But if they fail, you may

* Use `pgrep` command to check if seafile/seahub processes are still running


```
pgrep -f seafile-controller # check seafile processes
pgrep -f "seahub" # check seahub process

```

* Use `pkill` to kill the processes


```
pkill -f seafile-controller
pkill -f "seahub"

```

## Performance turning

If you have more than 50 users, we highly recommand you to [add memcached](../deploy/add_memcached.md). This is going to greatly speed up Seahub (the web frontend).  

## Setup in non-interactive way

Since Seafile Pro Edition version 5.1.4, `setup-seafile-mysql.sh` supports auto mode. You can run the setup script in non-interactive by supplying the needed parameters via script parameters or environment variables.

```sh
cd seafile-server-*
./setup-seafile-mysql.sh auto [param1] [param2]...

```

Related parameters as follow:
