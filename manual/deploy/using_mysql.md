# Installation of Seafile Server Community Edition with MySQL/MariaDB

This manual explains how to deploy and run Seafile Server Community Edition (Seafile CE) on a Linux server from a pre-built package using MySQL/MariaDB as database. The deployment has been tested for Debian/Ubuntu and CentOS, but Seafile should also work on other Linux distributions.

**Tip:** If you have little experience with Seafile Server, we recommend that you use an [installation script](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile-server-installer) for deploying Seafile.

## Requirements

Seafile CE for x86 architecture requires a minimum of 2 cores and 2GB RAM.

There is a community-supported package for the installation on Raspberry Pi.

## Setup


### Installing and preparing the SQL database

Seafile supports MySQL and MariaDB. We recommend that you use the preferred SQL database management engine included in the package repositories of your distribution. This means:

* CentOS and Debian: MariaDB
* Ubuntu: MySQL

You can find step-by-step how-tos for installing MySQL and MariaDB in the [tutorials on the Digital Ocean website](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials).

Seafile uses the mysql_native_password plugin for authentication. The versions of MySQL and MariaDB installed on CentOS 8, Debian 10, and Ubuntu 20.04 use a different authentication plugin by default. It is therefore required to change to authentication plugin to mysql_native_password for the root user prior to the installation of Seafile. The above mentioned tutorials explain how to do it.

```

### Creating the program directory

The standard directory for Seafile's program files is `/opt/seafile`. Create this directory and change into it:

```
mkdir /opt/seafile
cd /opt/seafile
```

The  program directory can be changed. The standard directory `/opt/seafile` is assumed for the rest of this manual. If you decide to put Seafile in another directory, modify the commands accordingly.

### Creating user seafile

It is good practice not to run applications as root. 

Create a new user and follow the instructions on the screen:

```
adduser seafile
```

Change ownership of the created directory to the new user:

```
chown -R seafile: /opt/seafile
```

All the following steps are done as user seafile.

Change to user seafile:

```
su seafile
```

### Downloading the install package

Download the install package from the [download page](https://www.seafile.com/en/download/) on Seafile's website using wget.

We use Seafile CE version 8.0.4 as an example in the rest of this manual.

### Uncompressing the package

The install package is downloaded as a compressed tarball which needs to be uncompressed.

Uncompress the package using tar:

```
tar xf seafile-server_8.0.4_x86-64.tar.gz
```

Now you have:

```
$ tree -L 2
.
├── seafile-server-8.0.4
│   ├── check_init_admin.py
│   ├── reset-admin.sh
│   ├── runtime
│   ├── seaf-fsck.sh
│   ├── seaf-fuse.sh
│   ├── seaf-gc.sh
│   ├── seafile
│   ├── seafile.sh
│   ├── seahub
│   ├── seahub.sh
│   ├── setup-seafile-mysql.py
│   ├── setup-seafile-mysql.sh
│   ├── setup-seafile.sh
│   ├── sql
│   └── upgrade
└── seafile-server_8.0.4_x86-64.tar.gz

```

### Setting up Seafile CE

The install package comes with a script that sets Seafile up for you. Specifically, the script creates the required directories and extracts all files in the right place. It can also create a MySQL user and the three databases that [Seafile's components](../overview/components.md) require :

* ccnet server
* seafile server
* seahub

Note: While ccnet server was merged into the seafile-server in Seafile 8.0, the corresponding database is still required for the time being.

Run the script as user seafile:

```
cd seafile-server-8.0.4
./setup-seafile-mysql.sh

```

Configure your Seafile Server by specifying the following three parameters:

| Option                | Description                                          | Note                                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| server name           | Name of the Seafile Server                           | 3-15 characters, only English letters, digits and underscore ('\_') are allowed |
| server's ip or domain | IP address or domain name used by the Seafile Server | Seafile client program will access the server using this address |
| fileserver port       | TCP port used by the Seafile fileserver              | Default port is 8082, it is recommended to use this port and to only change it if is used by other service |



In the next step, choose whether to create new databases for Seafile or to use existing databases. The creation of new databases requires the root password for the SQL server. 

![grafik](../images/seafile-setup-database.png)

When choosing "\[1] Create new ccnet/seafile/seahub databases", the script creates these databases and a MySQL user that Seafile Server will use to access them. To this effect, you need to answer these questions:

| Question                        | Description                                                  | Note                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| mysql server host               | Host address of the MySQL server                             | Default is localhost                                         |
| mysql server port               | TCP port used by the MySQL server                            | Default port is 3306; almost every MySQL server uses this port |
| mysql root password             | Password of the MySQL root account                           | The root password is required to create new databases and a MySQL user |
| mysql user for Seafile          | MySQL user created by the script, used by Seafile's components to access the databases | Default is seafile; the user is created unless it exists     |
| mysql password for Seafile user | Password for the user above, written in Seafile's config files | Percent sign ('%') is not allowed                            |
| database name                   | Name of the database used by ccnet                           | Default is "ccnet_db", the database is created if it does not exist |
| seafile database name           | Name of the database used by Seafile                         | Default is "seafile_db", the database is created if it does not exist |
| seahub database name            | Name of the database used by seahub                          | Default is "seahub_db", the database is created if it does not exist |

When choosing "\[2] Use existing ccnet/seafile/seahub databases", this are the prompts you need to answer: 

| Question                        | Description                                                  | Note                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| mysql server host               | Host address of the MySQL server                             | Default is localhost                                         |
| mysql server port               | TCP port used by MySQL server                                | Default port is 3306; almost every MySQL server uses this port |
| mysql user for Seafile          | User used by Seafile's components to access the databases    | The user must exists                                         |
| mysql password for Seafile user | Password for the user above                                  |                                                              |
| ccnet database name             | Name of the database used by ccnet, default is "ccnet_db"    | The database must exist                                      |
| seafile database name           | Name of the database used by Seafile, default is "seafile_db" | The database must exist                                      |
| seahub dabase name              | Name of the database used by Seahub, default is "seahub_db"  | The database must exist                                      |

If the setup is successful, you see the following output:

![grafik](../images/seafile-setup-output.png)

The directory layout then looks as follows:

```sh
$ tree /opt/seafile -L 2
seafile
├── ccnet
├── conf
│   └── ccnet.conf
│   └── gunicorn.conf.py
│   └── seafdav.conf
│   └── seafile.conf
│   └── seahub_settings.py
├── seafile-data
│   └── library-template
├── seafile-server-8.0.4
│   └── check_init_admin.py
│   ├── reset-admin.sh
│   ├── runtime
│   └── seaf-fsck.sh
│   └── seaf-gc.sh
│   ├── seafile
│   ├── seafile.sh
│   ├── seahub
│   ├── seahub.sh
│   └── setup-seafile-mysql.py
│   ├── setup-seafile-mysql.sh
│   └── sql
│   └── upgrade
├── seafile-server-latest -> seafile-server-8.0.6
├── seahub-data
│   └── avatars

```

The folder `seafile-server-latest` is a symbolic link to the current Seafile Server folder. When later you upgrade to a new version, the upgrade scripts update this link to point to the latest Seafile Server folder.



Note: If you don't have the root password, you need someone who has the privileges, e.g., the database admin, to create the three databases required by Seafile, as well as a MySQL user who can access the databases. For example, to create three databases `ccnet_db` / `seafile_db` / `seahub_db` for ccnet/seafile/seahub respectively, and a MySQL user "seafile" to access these databases run the following SQL queries:

```
create database `ccnet_db` character set = 'utf8';
create database `seafile_db` character set = 'utf8';
create database `seahub_db` character set = 'utf8';

create user 'seafile'@'localhost' identified by 'seafile';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `ccnet_db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `seafile_db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `seahub_db`.* to `seafile`@localhost;

```

### Setup Memory Cache

Seahub caches items(avatars, profiles, etc) on file system by default(/tmp/seahub_cache/). You can replace with Memcached or Redis.

#### Use Memcached

Use the following commands to install memcached and corresponding libraies on your system:

```
# on Debian/Ubuntu 18.04+
apt-get install memcached libmemcached-dev -y
pip3 install --timeout=3600 pylibmc django-pylibmc

systemctl enable --now memcached
```

Add the following configuration to `seahub_settings.py`.

```
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django_pylibmc.memcached.PyLibMCCache',
        'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',
    },
}

```

#### Use Redis

Redis is supported since version 11.0.

First, install Redis with package installers in your OS.

Then refer to [Django's documentation about using Redis cache](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/cache/#redis) to add Redis configurations to `seahub_settings.py`.


### Tweaking conf files

Seafile's config files as created by the setup script are prepared for Seafile running behind a reverse proxy.

To access Seafile's web interface and to create working sharing links without a reverse proxy, you need to modify two configuration files in `/opt/seafile/conf`:

* seahub_settings.py (if you use 9.0.x): Add port 8000 to the `SERVICE_URL` (i.e., SERVICE_URL = 'http://1.2.3.4:8000/').
* ccnet.conf (if you use 8.0.x or 7.1.x): Add port 8000 to the `SERVICE_URL` (i.e., SERVICE_URL = http://1.2.3.4:8000/).
* gunicorn.conf.py: Change the bind to "0.0.0.0:8000" (i.e., bind = "0.0.0.0:8000")

## Starting Seafile Server

Run the following commands in `/opt/seafile-server-latest`:

```
./seafile.sh start # starts seaf-server
./seahub.sh start  # starts seahub

```

The first time you start Seahub, the script prompts you to create an admin account for your Seafile Server. Enter the email address of the admin user followed by the password.

Now you can access Seafile via the web interface at the host address and port 8000 (e.g., http://1.2.3.4:8000)

Note: On CentOS, the firewall blocks traffic on port 8000 by default.


### Troubleshooting

If seafile.sh and/or seahub.sh fail to run successfully, use `pgrep` to check if seafile/seahub processes are still running:


```
pgrep -f seafile-controller # checks seafile processes
pgrep -f "seahub" # checks seahub process

```

Use `pkill` to kill the processes:


```
pkill -f seafile-controller
pkill -f "seahub"

```

## Stopping and Restarting Seafile and Seahub

### Stopping

```
./seahub.sh stop 	# stops seahub
./seafile.sh stop 	# stops seaf-server

```

### Restarting

```
./seafile.sh restart
./seahub.sh restart

```

## Enabling HTTPS

It is strongly recommended to switch from unencrypted HTTP (via port 8000) to encrypted HTTPS (via port 443).

This manual provides instructions for enabling HTTPS for the two most popular web servers and reverse proxies:

* [Nginx](https://manual.seafile.com/deploy/https_with_nginx/)
* [Apache](https://manual.seafile.com/deploy/https_with_apache/)
