# Config Seahub with Nginx

## Deploy Seahub/FileServer with Nginx

Seahub is the web interface of Seafile server. FileServer is used to handle raw file uploading/downloading through browsers. By default, it listens on port 8082 for HTTP requests.

Here we deploy Seahub and FileServer with reverse proxy. We assume you are running Seahub using domain `seafile.example.com`.

This is a sample Nginx config file.

In Ubuntu 16.04, you can add the config file as follows:

1. create file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/seafile.conf`
2. Delete `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`: `rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`
3. Create symbolic link: `ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seafile.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/seafile.conf`

```nginx

log_format seafileformat '$http_x_forwarded_for $remote_addr [$time_local] "$request" $status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" $upstream_response_time';

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name seafile.example.com;

    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;

    location / {
         proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8000;
         proxy_set_header   Host $host;
         proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
         proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
         proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;
         proxy_read_timeout  1200s;

         # used for view/edit office file via Office Online Server
         client_max_body_size 0;

         access_log      /var/log/nginx/seahub.access.log seafileformat;
         error_log       /var/log/nginx/seahub.error.log;
    }

# If you are using [FastCGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI),

    location /seafhttp {
        rewrite ^/seafhttp(.*)$ $1 break;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8082;
        client_max_body_size 0;

        send_timeout  36000s;

        access_log      /var/log/nginx/seafhttp.access.log seafileformat;

Nginx settings `client_max_body_size` is by default 1M. Uploading a file bigger than this limit will give you an error message HTTP error code 413 ("Request Entity Too Large").

You should use 0 to disable this feature or write the same value than for the parameter `max_upload_size` in section `[fileserver]` of [seafile.conf](../config/seafile-conf.md). Client uploads are only partly effected by this limit. With a limit of 100 MiB they can safely upload files of any size.

Tip for uploading very large files (> 4GB): By default Nginx will buffer large request bodies in temp files. After the body is completely received, Nginx will send the body to the upstream server (seaf-server in our case). But it seems when the file size is very large, the buffering mechanism dosen't work well. It may stop proxying the body in the middle. So if you want to support file uploads larger than 4GB, we suggest to install Nginx version >= 1.8.0 and add the following options to Nginx config file:

```nginx
    location /seafhttp {
        ... ...
        proxy_request_buffering off;
    }
```

## Modify ccnet.conf and seahub_setting.py

### Modify ccnet.conf

You need to modify the value of `SERVICE_URL` in [ccnet.conf](../config/ccnet-conf.md) to let Seafile know the domain, protocol and port you choose. You can also modify `SERVICE_URL` via web UI in "System Admin->Settings". (**Warning**: If you set the value both via Web UI and ccnet.conf, the setting via Web UI will take precedence.)

```python
SERVICE_URL = http://seafile.example.com
```

Note: If you later change the domain assigned to Seahub, you also need to change the value of  `SERVICE_URL`.

### Modify seahub_settings.py

You need to add a line in `seahub_settings.py` to set the value of `FILE_SERVER_ROOT`. You can also modify `FILE_SERVER_ROOT` via web UI in "System Admin->Settings". (**Warning**: if you set the value both via Web UI and seahub_settings.py, the setting via Web UI will take precedence.)


```python
FILE_SERVER_ROOT = 'http://seafile.example.com/seafhttp'
```

## Start Seafile and Seahub

```bash
./seafile.sh start
./seahub.sh start # or "./seahub.sh start-fastcgi" if you're using fastcgi
```
