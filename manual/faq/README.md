## Clustering

### Page layout broken because seahub/media/CACHE is created only on first node

Please add

```
COMPRESS_CACHE_BACKEND = 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache'

```

to `seahub_settings.py` as documented at [Deploy in a Cluster](../deploy_pro/deploy_in_a_cluster.md)

This is going to tell every node to generate the CSS CACHE in its local folder.
