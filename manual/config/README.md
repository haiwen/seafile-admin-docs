# Server Configuration and Customization

## Config Files

**Important**: Since Seafile Server 5.0.0, all config files are moved to the central **conf** folder. [Read More](../deploy/new_directory_layout_5_0_0.md).

There are three config files in the community edition:

* [ccnet.conf](ccnet-conf.md): contains the LDAP settings
* [seafile.conf](seafile-conf.md): contains settings for seafile daemon and fileserver.
* [seahub_settings.py](seahub_settings_py.md): contains settings for Seahub

There is one additional config file in the pro edition:

* [seafevents.conf](seafevents-conf.md): contains settings for search and documents preview

Note: Since version 5.0.0, you can also modify most of the config items via web interface.The config items are saved in database table (seahub-db/constance_config). They have a higher priority over the items in config files.
