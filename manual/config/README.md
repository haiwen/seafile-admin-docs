# Server Configuration and Customization

## Config Files

There are three config files in the community edition:

* [environment variables](env.md): contains the components and environment variables settings of Seafile-docker instance
* [ccnet.conf](ccnet-conf.md): contains the LDAP settings
* [seafile.conf](seafile-conf.md): contains settings for seafile daemon and fileserver.
* [seahub_settings.py](seahub_settings_py.md): contains settings for Seahub
* [seafevents.conf](seafevents-conf.md): contains settings for background tasks and file search

You can also modify most of the config items via web interface.The config items are saved in database table (seahub-db/constance_config). They have a higher priority over the items in config files.
