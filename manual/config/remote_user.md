# SSO using Remote User

Starting from 7.0.0, Seafile can integrate with various Single Sign On systems via a proxy server. Examples include Apache as Shibboleth proxy, or LemonLdap as a proxy to LDAP servers, or Apache as Kerberos proxy. Seafile can retrieve user information from special request headers (HTTP_REMOTE_USER, HTTP_X_AUTH_USER, etc.) set by the proxy servers.

After the proxy server (Apache/Nginx) is successfully authenticated, the user information is set to the request header, and Seafile creates and logs in the user based on this information.

!!! danger "Make sure that the proxy server has a corresponding security mechanism to protect against forgery request header attacks"

Please add the following settings to `conf/seahub_settings.py` to enable this feature.

```
ENABLE_REMOTE_USER_AUTHENTICATION = True

# Optional, HTTP header, which is configured in your web server conf file,
# used for Seafile to get user's unique id, default value is 'HTTP_REMOTE_USER'.
REMOTE_USER_HEADER = 'HTTP_REMOTE_USER'

# Optional, when the value of HTTP_REMOTE_USER is not a valid email addressï¼Œ
# Seafile will build a email-like unique id from the value of 'REMOTE_USER_HEADER'
# and this domain, e.g. user1@example.com.
REMOTE_USER_DOMAIN = 'example.com'

# Optional, whether to create new user in Seafile system, default value is True.
# If this setting is disabled, users doesn't preexist in the Seafile DB cannot login.
# The admin has to first import the users from external systems like LDAP.
REMOTE_USER_CREATE_UNKNOWN_USER = True

# Optional, whether to activate new user in Seafile system, default value is True.
# If this setting is disabled, user will be unable to login by default.
# the administrator needs to manually activate this user.
REMOTE_USER_ACTIVATE_USER_AFTER_CREATION = True

# Optional, map user attribute in HTTP header and Seafile's user attribute.
REMOTE_USER_ATTRIBUTE_MAP = {
    'HTTP_DISPLAYNAME': 'name',
    'HTTP_MAIL': 'contact_email',

    # for user info
    "HTTP_GIVENNAME": 'givenname',
    "HTTP_SN": 'surname',
    "HTTP_ORGANIZATION": 'institution',
    
    # for user role
    'HTTP_SHIBBOLETH_AFFILIATION': 'affiliation',
}

# Map affiliation to user role. Though the config name is SHIBBOLETH_AFFILIATION_ROLE_MAP,
# it is not restricted to Shibboleth
SHIBBOLETH_AFFILIATION_ROLE_MAP = {
    'employee@uni-mainz.de': 'staff',
    'member@uni-mainz.de': 'staff',
    'student@uni-mainz.de': 'student',
    'employee@hu-berlin.de': 'guest',
    'patterns': (
        ('*@hu-berlin.de', 'guest1'),
        ('*@*.de', 'guest2'),
        ('*', 'guest'),
    ),
}

```

Then restart Seafile.
