# Seahub Settings

Note: You can also modify most of the config items via web interface. The config items are saved in database table (seahub-db/constance_config). They have a higher priority over the items in config files. If you want to disable settings via web interface, you can add `ENABLE_SETTINGS_VIA_WEB = False` to `seahub_settings.py`.

## Sending Email Notifications on Seahub

Refer to [email sending documentation](sending_email.md).

## Memcached

Seahub caches items(avatars, profiles, etc) on file system by default(/tmp/seahub_cache/). You can replace with Memcached.

Refer to ["add memcached"](../deploy/add_memcached.md).

## Security settings

```python
# For security consideration, please set to match the host/domain of your site, e.g., ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.example.com'].
# Please refer https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts for details.
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.myseafile.com']

```

## Cloud Mode

You should enable cloud mode if you use Seafile with an unknown user base. It disables the organization tab in Seahub's website to ensure that users can't access the user list. Cloud mode provides some nice features like sharing content with unregistered users and sending invitations to them. Therefore you also want to enable user registration. Through the global address book (since version 4.2.3) you can do a search for every user account. So you probably want to disable it.

```python
# Enable cloude mode and hide `Organization` tab.
CLOUD_MODE = True

# Disable global address book
ENABLE_GLOBAL_ADDRESSBOOK = False
```

## External authentication

```python
# Enable authentication with ADFS

# Enable authentication wit Kerberos
# Default is False

# Enable authentication with Shibboleth
# Default is False
ENABLE_SHIBBOLETH_LOGIN = True

```

```

## Seahub Custom Functions

Since version 6.2, you can define a custom function to modify the result of user search function.

For example, if you want to limit user only search users in the same institution, you can define `custom_search_user` function in `{seafile install path}/conf/seahub_custom_functions/__init__.py`

Code example:

```
import os
import sys

current_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
seahub_dir = os.path.join(current_path, \
        '../../seafile-server-latest/seahub/seahub')
sys.path.append(seahub_dir)

from seahub.profile.models import Profile
def custom_search_user(request, emails):

    institution_name = ''

    username = request.user.username
    profile = Profile.objects.get_profile_by_user(username)
    if profile:
        institution_name = profile.institution

    inst_users = [p.user for p in
            Profile.objects.filter(institution=institution_name)]

    filtered_emails = []
    for email in emails:
        if email in inst_users:
            filtered_emails.append(email)

    return filtered_emails

```

> **NOTE**, you should NOT change the name of `custom_search_user` and `seahub_custom_functions/__init__.py`

Since version 6.2.5 pro, if you enable the **ENABLE_SHARE_TO_ALL_GROUPS** feather on sysadmin settings page, you can also define a custom function to return the groups a user can share library to.

For example, if you want to let a user to share library to both its groups and the groups of user `test@test.com`, you can define a `custom_get_groups` function in `{seafile install path}/conf/seahub_custom_functions/__init__.py`

Code example:

```
import os
import sys

current_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
seaserv_dir = os.path.join(current_path, \
        '../../seafile-server-latest/seafile/lib64/python2.7/site-packages')
sys.path.append(seaserv_dir)

def custom_get_groups(request):

    from seaserv import ccnet_api

    groups = []
    username = request.user.username

    # for current user
    groups += ccnet_api.get_groups(username)

    # for 'test@test.com' user
    groups += ccnet_api.get_groups('test@test.com')

    return groups

```

> **NOTE**, you should NOT change the name of `custom_get_groups` and `seahub_custom_functions/__init__.py`

## Note

* You need to restart seahub so that your changes take effect.
* If your changes don't take effect, You may need to delete 'seahub_setting.pyc'. (A cache file)

```bash
./seahub.sh restart

```
