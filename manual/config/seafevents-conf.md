# Configurable Options

In the file `seafevents.conf`:

```
[STATISTICS]
## must be "true" to enable statistics
enabled = true

[SEAHUB EMAIL]
## must be "true" to enable user email notifications when there are new unread notifications
enabled = true

## interval of sending Seahub email. Can be s(seconds), m(minutes), h(hours), d(days)
interval = 30m

[FILE HISTORY]
enabled = true
threshold = 5
suffix = md,txt,...

## From seafile 7.0.0
## Recording file history to database for fast access is enabled by default for 'Markdown, .txt, ppt, pptx, doc, docx, xls, xlsx'. 
## After enable the feature, the old histories version for markdown, doc, docx files will not be list in the history page.
## (Only new histories that stored in database will be listed) But the users can still access the old versions in the library snapshots.
## For file types not listed in the suffix , histories version will be scanned from the library history as before.
## The feature default is enable. You can set the 'enabled = false' to disable the feature.

## The 'threshold' is the time threshold for recording the historical version of a file, in minutes, the default is 5 minutes. 
## This means that if the interval between two adjacent file saves is less than 5 minutes, the two file changes will be merged and recorded as a historical version. 
## When set to 0, there is no time limit, which means that each save will generate a separate historical version.

## If you need to modify the file list format, you can add 'suffix = md, txt, ...' configuration items to achieve.
```

highlight = fvh

## If true, indexes the contents of office/pdf files while updating search index

## From 9.0.7 pro, Seafile supports connecting to Elasticsearch through username and password, you need to configure username and password for the Elasticsearch server
username = elastic           # username to connect to Elasticsearch

## From 9.0.7 pro, Seafile supports connecting to elasticsearch via HTTPS, you need to configure HTTPS for the Elasticsearch server
scheme = https               # The default is http. If the Elasticsearch server is not configured with HTTPS, the scheme and cafile do not need to be configured
cafile = path/to/cert.pem    # The certificate path for user authentication. If the Elasticsearch server does not enable certificate authentication, do not need to be configured

## From version 11.0.5 Pro, you can custom ElasticSearch index names for distinct instances when intergrating multiple Seafile servers to a single ElasticSearch Server.
repo_status_index_name = your-repo-status-index-name  # default is `repo_head`
repo_files_index_name = your-repo-files-index-name    # default is `repofiles`

seasearch_url = http://seasearch:4080 # If your SeaSearch server deploy on another machine, replace it to the truth address
seasearch_token = <your auth token> # base64 code consist of `username:password`
interval = 10m # The interval the search index is updated. Can be s(seconds), m(minutes), h(hours), d(days)
