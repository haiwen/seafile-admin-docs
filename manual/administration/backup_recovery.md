## Overview

There are generally two parts of data to backup

* Seafile library data
* Databases

There are 3 databases:

* ccnet_db: contains user and group information
* seafile_db: contains library metadata
* seahub_db: contains tables used by the web front end (seahub)


## Backup steps

The backup is a two step procedure:

1. Backup the databases;
2. Backup the seafile data directory;

## Backup Order: Database First or Data Directory First

* backup data directory first, SQL later: When you're backing up data directory, some new objects are written and they're not backed up. Those new objects may be referenced in SQL database. So when you restore, some records in the database cannot find its object. So the library is corrupted.
* backup SQL first, data directory later: Since you backup database first, all records in the database have valid objects to be referenced. So the libraries won't be corrupted. But new objects written to storage when you're backing up are not referenced by database records. So some libraries are out of date. When you restore, some new data are lost.

The second sequence is better in the sense that it avoids library corruption. Like other backup solutions, some new data can be lost in recovery. There is always a backup window.
However, if your storage backup mechanism can finish quickly enough, using the first sequence can retain more data.

We assume your seafile data directory is in `/opt/seafile` for binary package based deployment (or `/opt/seafile-data` for docker based deployment). And you want to backup to `/backup` directory. The `/backup` can be an NFS or Windows share mount exported by another machine, or just an external disk. You can create a layout similar to the following in `/backup` directory:

```
/backup
---- databases/  contains database backup files
---- data/  contains backups of the data directory

```

## Backup and restore for binary package based deployment

### Backing up Databases

It's recommended to backup the database to a separate file each time. Don't overwrite older database backups for at least a week.

Assume your database names are `ccnet_db`, `seafile_db` and `seahub_db`. mysqldump automatically locks the tables so you don't need to stop Seafile server when backing up MySQL databases. Since the database tables are usually very small, it won't take long to dump.

```
mysqldump -h [mysqlhost] -u[username] -p[password] --opt ccnet_db > /backup/databases/ccnet_db.sql.`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`

mysqldump -h [mysqlhost] -u[username] -p[password] --opt seafile_db > /backup/databases/seafile_db.sql.`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`

mysqldump -h [mysqlhost] -u[username] -p[password] --opt seahub_db > /backup/databases/seahub_db.sql.`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`

```

!!! danger "`mysqldump`: command not found"
    You may encounter this problem on some machines with a minimal (from 10.5) or a newer (from 11.0) Mariadb server installed, of which the `mysql*` series of commands [have been gradually deprecated](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30203). If you encounter this error, use the `mariadb-dump` command, such as:

    ```sh
    mariadb-dump -h [mysqlhost] -u[username] -p[password] --opt ccnet_db > /backup/databases/ccnet_db.sql.`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`

    mariadb-dump -h [mysqlhost] -u[username] -p[password] --opt seafile_db > /backup/databases/seafile_db.sql.`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`

    mariadb-dump -h [mysqlhost] -u[username] -p[password] --opt seahub_db > /backup/databases/seahub_db.sql.`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`
    ```

### Backing up Seafile library data

The data files are all stored in the `/opt/seafile` directory, so just back up the whole directory. You can directly copy the whole directory to the backup destination, or you can use rsync to do incremental backup. 

To directly copy the whole data directory,

```
cp -R /opt/seafile /backup/data/seafile-`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`
```

This produces a separate copy of the data directory each time. You can delete older backup copies after a new one is completed.

If you have a lot of data, copying the whole data directory would take long. You can use rsync to do incremental backup.

```
rsync -az /opt/seafile /backup/data

```

This command backup the data directory to `/backup/data/seafile`.

### Restore from backup

Now supposed your primary seafile server is broken, you're switching to a new machine. Using the backup data to restore your Seafile instance:

1. Copy `/backup/data/seafile` to the new machine. Let's assume the seafile deployment location new machine is also `/opt/seafile`.
2. Restore the database.
3. Since database and data are backed up separately, they may become a little inconsistent with each other. To correct the potential inconsistency, run seaf-fsck tool to check data integrity on the new machine. See [seaf-fsck documentation](seafile_fsck.md).

#### Restore the databases

Now with the latest valid database backup files at hand, you can restore them.


```
mysql -u[username] -p[password] ccnet_db < ccnet_db.sql.2013-10-19-16-00-05
mysql -u[username] -p[password] seafile_db < seafile_db.sql.2013-10-19-16-00-20
mysql -u[username] -p[password] seahub_db < seahub_db.sql.2013-10-19-16-01-05

```

!!! danger "`mysql`: command not found"
    You may encounter this problem on some machines with a minimal (from 10.5) or a newer (from 11.0) Mariadb server installed, of which the `mysql*` series of commands [have been gradually deprecated](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30203). If you encounter this error, use the `mariadb` command, such as:

    ```sh
    mariadb -u[username] -p[password] ccnet_db < ccnet_db.sql.2013-10-19-16-00-05
    mariadb -u[username] -p[password] seafile_db < seafile_db.sql.2013-10-19-16-00-20
    mariadb -u[username] -p[password] seahub_db < seahub_db.sql.2013-10-19-16-01-05
    ```

## Backup and restore for Docker based deployment

### Structure

We assume your seafile volumns path is in `/opt/seafile-data`. And you want to backup to `/backup` directory.


The data files to be backed up:

```
/opt/seafile-data/seafile/conf  # configuration files
/opt/seafile-data/seafile/seafile-data # data of seafile
/opt/seafile-data/seafile/seahub-data # data of seahub

```


### Backing up Database

```bash
# It's recommended to backup the database to a separate file each time. Don't overwrite older database backups for at least a week.
cd /backup/databases
docker exec -it seafile-mysql mariadb-dump  -u[username] -p[password] --opt ccnet_db > ccnet_db.sql
docker exec -it seafile-mysql mariadb-dump  -u[username] -p[password] --opt seafile_db > seafile_db.sql
docker exec -it seafile-mysql mariadb-dump  -u[username] -p[password] --opt seahub_db > seahub_db.sql
```

!!! tip
    The default image of database is ***Mariadb 10.11*** from Seafile 12, you may not be able to find these commands in the container (such as `mysqldump: command not found`), since commands of `mysql*` series [have been gradually deprecated](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30203). So we recommend that you use the `mariadb*` series of commands. 
    
    However, **if you still use the *MySQL* docker image**, you should continue to use `mysqldump` here:

    ```sh
    docker exec -it seafile-mysql mysqldump  -u[username] -p[password] --opt ccnet_db > ccnet_db.sql
    docker exec -it seafile-mysql mysqldump  -u[username] -p[password] --opt seafile_db > seafile_db.sql
    docker exec -it seafile-mysql mysqldump  -u[username] -p[password] --opt seahub_db > seahub_db.sql
    ```


###  Backing up Seafile library data

#### To directly copy the whole data directory

```bash
cp -R /opt/seafile-data/seafile /backup/data/
```

#### Use rsync to do incremental backup

```bash
rsync -az /opt/seafile-data/seafile /backup/data/
```

### Recovery

#### Restore the databases

```bash
docker cp /backup/databases/ccnet_db.sql seafile-mysql:/tmp/ccnet_db.sql
docker cp /backup/databases/seafile_db.sql seafile-mysql:/tmp/seafile_db.sql
docker cp /backup/databases/seahub_db.sql seafile-mysql:/tmp/seahub_db.sql

docker exec -it seafile-mysql /bin/sh -c "mariadb -u[username] -p[password] ccnet_db < /tmp/ccnet_db.sql"
docker exec -it seafile-mysql /bin/sh -c "mariadb -u[username] -p[password] seafile_db < /tmp/seafile_db.sql"
docker exec -it seafile-mysql /bin/sh -c "mariadb -u[username] -p[password] seahub_db < /tmp/seahub_db.sql"
```

    ```

### Restore the seafile data

```bash
cp -R /backup/data/* /opt/seafile-data/seafile/
```
