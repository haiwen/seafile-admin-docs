# Introduction

Seafile is an open source cloud storage system with file encryption and group sharing.

Collections of files are called libraries, and each library can be synced separately. A library can be encrypted with a user chosen password. This password is not stored on the server, so even the server admin cannot view a file's contents.

Seafile allows users to create groups with file syncing, a wiki and discussions to enable easy collaboration around documents within a team.
