_Note:_ Before you try to deploy file search office documents preview, make sure other parts of your seafile cluster are already working, e.g upload/download files in a web browser. Make sure memcached is configured as described in ["Deploy in a cluster"](./deploy_in_a_cluster.md).

# Enable search and background tasks in a cluster

In the seafile cluster, only one server should run the background tasks, including:

* indexing files for search
* email notification
* office documents converts service
* LDAP sync
* virus scan

Let's assume you have three nodes in your cluster: A, B, and C.

* Node A is backend node that run background tasks.
* Node B and C are frontend nodes that serving requests from clients.

## 7.0 or before

### Configuring Node A (the backend node)

If you following the steps on settings up a cluster, node B and node C should have already be configed as frontend node. You can copy the configuration of node B as a base for node A. Then do the following steps:

#### Install Dependencies (Java, LibreOffice, poppler)

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```shell
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre libreoffice poppler-utils python-uno # or python3-uno for ubuntu 16.04+

```

On CentOS/Red Hat:

```shell
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
sudo yum install libreoffice libreoffice-headless libreoffice-pyuno
sudo yum install poppler-utils

```

Edit **seafevents.conf** and ensure this line does NOT exist:

```
external_es_server = true

```

Edit **seahub_settings.py** and add a line:

```python
OFFICE_CONVERTOR_NODE = True

```

Edit **seafile.conf** to enable virus scan according to [virus scan document](virus_scan.md)

#### Edit the firewall rules

In your firewall rules for node A, you should open the port 9200 (for search requests). For versions older than 6.1, `es_port` was 9500.

### Configure Other Nodes

On nodes B and C, you need to:

* Edit `seafevents.conf`, add the following lines:


```
[INDEX FILES]
enabled = true
external_es_server = true
es_host = <ip of node A>
es_port = 9200

```

Edit **seahub_settings.py** and add a line:

```python
OFFICE_CONVERTOR_ROOT = 'http://<ip of node A>'

```

Make sure requests to http\://<ip of node A> is also handled by Seahub. For example, you may need to add this Nginx configuration in the background node:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <IP of node A>;
    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        ...
  }

```

As a simple test, you can use this command to test if you set it up correctly.

```shell
curl -v http://<IP of node A>/office-convert/internal/status/

```

It should say "400 Bad Request" when you have Nginx config updated.

### Start the background node

Type the following commands to start the background node (Note, one additional command `seafile-background-tasks.sh` is needed)

```shell
./seafile.sh start
./seahub.sh start # or "./seahub.sh start-fastcgi" if you're using fastcgi
./seafile-background-tasks.sh start

```

To stop the background node, type:

```shell
./seafile-background-tasks.sh stop
./seafile.sh stop
./seahub.sh stop

```

You should also configure Seafile background tasks to start on system bootup. For systemd based OS, you can add `/etc/systemd/system/seafile-background-tasks.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Seafile Background Tasks Server
After=network.target seahub.service

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest/seafile-background-tasks.sh start
ExecStop=/opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest/seafile-background-tasks.sh stop
User=root
Group=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

Then enable this task in systemd:

```
systemctl enable seafile-background-tasks.service

```

### The final configuration of the background node

Here is the summary of configurations at the background node that related to clustering setup.

For **seafile.conf**:

```
[cluster]
enabled = true
memcached_options = --SERVER=<IP of memcached node> --POOL-MIN=10 --POOL-MAX=100

```

For **seahub_settings.py**:

```
OFFICE_CONVERTOR_NODE = True

AVATAR_FILE_STORAGE = 'seahub.base.database_storage.DatabaseStorage'
COMPRESS_CACHE_BACKEND = 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache'

```

For **seafevents.conf**:

```
[INDEX FILES]
enabled = true
interval = 10m

[OFFICE CONVERTER]
enabled = true
workers = 1
## the max size of documents allowed to be previewed online, in MB. Default is 10 MB
## Previewing a large file (for example >30M) online is likely going to freeze the browser.
max-size = 10

```

## 7.1+

### Configuring Node A (the backend node)

If you following the steps on settings up a cluster, node B and node C should have already be configed as frontend node. You can copy the configuration of node B as a base for node A. Then do the following steps:

#### Install Dependencies (Java, LibreOffice)

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```shell
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre libreoffice python-uno # or python3-uno for ubuntu 16.04+

```

On CentOS/Red Hat:

```shell
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
sudo yum install libreoffice libreoffice-headless libreoffice-pyuno

```

Edit **seafevents.conf** and ensure this line does NOT exist:

```
external_es_server = true

```

Edit **seafevents.conf**, adding the following configuration:

```
[OFFICE CONVERTER]
enabled = true
host = <ip of node background>
port = 6000

```

host is the IP address of background node, make sure the front end nodes can access the background node via IP:6000 .

Edit **seafile.conf** to enable virus scan according to [virus scan document](virus_scan.md)

#### Edit the firewall rules

In your firewall rules for node A, you should open the port 9200 (for search requests) and port 6000 for office converter. For versions older than 6.1, `es_port` was 9500.



### Configure Other Nodes

On nodes B and C, you need to:

Edit `seafevents.conf`, add the following lines:

```
[INDEX FILES]
enabled = true
external_es_server = true
es_host = <ip of node A>
es_port = 9200

[OFFICE CONVERTER]
enabled = true
host = <ip of node background>
port = 6000

```

Edit **seahub_settings.py** and add a line:

```python
OFFICE_CONVERTOR_ROOT = 'http://<ip of node background>:6000'

```

### Start the background node

Type the following commands to start the background node (Note, one additional command `seafile-background-tasks.sh` is needed)

```shell
./seafile.sh start
./seafile-background-tasks.sh start

```

To stop the background node, type:

```shell
./seafile-background-tasks.sh stop
./seafile.sh stop

```

You should also configure Seafile background tasks to start on system bootup. For systemd based OS, you can add `/etc/systemd/system/seafile-background-tasks.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Seafile Background Tasks Server
After=network.target seahub.service

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest/seafile-background-tasks.sh start
ExecStop=/opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest/seafile-background-tasks.sh stop
User=root
Group=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

Then enable this task in systemd:

```
systemctl enable seafile-background-tasks.service

```

### The final configuration of the background node

Here is the summary of configurations at the background node that related to clustering setup.

For **seafile.conf**:

```
[cluster]
enabled = true
memcached_options = --SERVER=<IP of memcached node> --POOL-MIN=10 --POOL-MAX=100

```

For **seafevents.conf**:

```
[INDEX FILES]
enabled = true
interval = 10m
highlight = fvh  # this is for improving the search speed

[OFFICE CONVERTER]
enabled = true
host = <ip of node background>
port = 6000

```
