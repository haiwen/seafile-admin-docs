# Migrate from Seafile Community Server

## Restriction

It's quite likely you have deployed the Seafile Community Server and want to switch to the [Professional Server](http://seafile.com/en/product/private_server/), or vice versa. But there are some restrictions:

* You can only switch between Community Server and Professional Server of the same minor version.

That means, if you are using Community Server version 7.0, and want to switch to the Professional Server 7.1, you must first upgrade to Community Server version 7.1, and then follow the guides below to switch to the Professional Server 7.1. (The last tiny version number in 7.1.x is not important.)

## Preparation

### Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

> Since version 9.0.0, JRE is no longer required to be installed. Elasticsearch needs to be installed and managed individually.

Java 8 or higher is required.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre

```

On CentOS:

```
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

```

_Note_: Since version 7.0.0, java 1.8 is required, please check your java version by `java -version`.

### Install poppler-utils

The package poppler-utils is required for full text search of pdf files.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils

```

On CentOS/Red Hat:

```
sudo yum install poppler-utils

```

## Do the migration

We assume you already have deployed Seafile Community Server 7.0.0 under `/opt/seafile/seafile-server-7.0.0`. 

### Get the license

If the license you received is not named as seafile-license.txt, rename it to seafile-license.txt. Then put the license file under the top level diretory. In our example, it is `/opt/seafile/`.

### Download & uncompress Seafile Professional Server

You should uncompress the tarball to the top level directory of your installation, in our example it is `/opt/seafile`.

```
tar xf seafile-pro-server_7.0.0_x86-64.tar.gz

```

Now you have:

```
seafile
├── seafile-license.txt
├── seafile-pro-server-7.0.0/
├── seafile-server-7.0.0/
├── ccnet/
├── seafile-data/
├── seahub-data/
└── conf/
└── logs/

```

---

You should notice the difference between the names of the Community Server and Professional Server. Take the 7.0.0 64bit version as an example:

* Seafile Community Server tarball is `seafile-server_7.0.0_x86-86.tar.gz`; After uncompressing, the folder is `seafile-server-7.0.0`
* Seafile Professional Server tarball is `seafile-pro-server_7.0.0_x86-86.tar.gz`; After uncompressing, the folder is `seafile-pro-server-7.0.0`
    

### Do the migration

* Stop Seafile Community Server if it's running


```
cd haiwen/seafile-server-7.0.0
./seafile.sh stop
./seahub.sh stop

```

* Run the migration script 


```
cd haiwen/seafile-pro-server-7.0.0/
./pro/pro.py setup --migrate

```

The migration script is going to do the following for you:

* ensure your have all the prerequisites met
* create necessary extra configurations
* update the avatar directory
* create extra database tables

Now you have:

```
haiwen
├── seafile-license.txt
├── seafile-pro-server-7.0.0/
├── seafile-server-7.0.0/
├── ccnet/
├── seafile-data/
├── seahub-data/
├── seahub.db
├── seahub_settings.py
└── pro-data/

```

> **!Note:** If you upgraded from CE 6.3 to CE 7.0 first, then migrated to Pro 7.0. You also need to log in to MySQL server and create the following data tables in `seafile-db` .

```
FileLockTimestamp
FileLocks
FolderGroupPerm
FolderPermTimestamp
FolderUserPerm
GCID
LastGCID
OrgGroupRepo
OrgInnerPubRepo
OrgRepo
OrgSharedRepo
RepoStorageId
RoleQuota

```

For the table statement, please check [table statement](./seafile-sql.md).

### Start Seafile Professional Server

```
cd haiwen/seafile-pro-server-7.0.0
./seafile.sh start
./seahub.sh start

```

## Switch Back to Community Server

* Stop Seafile Professional Server if it's running


```
cd haiwen/seafile-pro-server-7.0.0/
./seafile.sh stop
./seahub.sh stop

```

* Update the avatar directory link just like in [Minor Upgrade](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile/wiki/Upgrading-Seafile-Server#minor-upgrade-like-from-150-to-151)


```
cd haiwen/seafile-server-7.0.0/
./upgrade/minor-upgrade.sh

```

* Start Seafile Community Server


```
cd haiwen/seafile-server-7.0.0/
./seafile.sh start
./seahub.sh start

```
