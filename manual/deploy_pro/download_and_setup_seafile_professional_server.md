### Minimum System Requirements

* A Linux server with 2GB RAM

### Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

On Debian:

```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre

```

On Ubuntu 16.04:

```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java /usr/bin/

```

On CentOS/Red Hat:

```
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

```

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```

sudo pip install boto

```

```

### Install all libraries required by the Community Edition

See [Download and Setup Seafile Server With MySQL](../deploy/using_mysql.md).

## Download and Setup Seafile Professional Server

### Get the license

Put the license you got under the top level diretory. In our wiki, we use the diretory `/data/haiwen/` as the top level directory. If you're using the free Pro Edition with three users you don't need a license file.

### Download & uncompress Seafile Professional Server

```
tar xf seafile-pro-server_7.0.7_x86-64.tar.gz

```

Now you have:

```
haiwen
├── seafile-license.txt
└── seafile-pro-server-7.0.7/

```

---

You should notice the difference between the names of the Community Server and Professional Server. Take the 7.0.7 64bit version as an example:

* Seafile Community Server tarball is `seafile-server_7.0.7_x86-86.tar.gz`; After uncompressing, the folder is `seafile-server-7.0.7`
* Seafile Professional Server tarball is `seafile-pro-server_7.0.7_x86-86.tar.gz`; After uncompressing, the folder is `seafile-pro-server-7.0.7`

### Setup

The setup process of Seafile Professional Server is the same as the Seafile Community Server. See [Download and Setup Seafile Server With MySQL](../deploy/using_mysql.md).

If you have any problem with setting up the service, please check [Common problems in setting up Seafile server](../deploy/common_problems_for_setting_up_server.md).

After you have succesfully setup Seafile Professional Server, you have a directory layout like this:

```
#tree haiwen -L 2
haiwen
├── seafile-license.txt # license file
├── ccnet               # configuration files
│   ├── mykey.peer
│   ├── PeerMgr
│   └── seafile.ini
├── conf
│   └── ccnet.conf
│   └── seafile.conf
│   └── seahub_settings.py
│   └── seafevents.conf
├── pro-data            # data specific for professional version
├── seafile-data
├── seafile-pro-server-7.0.7
│   ├── reset-admin.sh
│   ├── runtime
│   ├── seafile
│   ├── seafile.sh
│   ├── seahub
│   ├── seahub-extra
│   ├── seahub.sh
│   ├── setup-seafile.sh
│   ├── setup-seafile-mysql.py
│   ├── setup-seafile-mysql.sh
│   └── upgrade
├── seahub-data
│   └── avatars         # for user avatars
├── seahub.db

```

## Performance tuning

If you have more than 50 Seafile users, we highly recommend to [add memcached](../deploy/add_memcached.md). This is going to speedup Seahub (the web front end) significantly.

## Done

At this point, the basic setup of Seafile Professional Server is done.
