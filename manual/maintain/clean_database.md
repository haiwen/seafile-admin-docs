# Clean Database

## Seahub

### Session

Since version 5.0, we offered command to clear expired session records in Seahub database.

```
cd <install-path>/seafile-server-latest
./seahub.sh python-env seahub/manage.py clearsessions

```

### Activity

To clean the activity records, login in to MySQL/MariaDB and use the following command:

```
use seahub_db;
DELETE FROM Event WHERE to_days(now()) - to_days(timestamp) > 90;

```

The corresponding items in UserEvent will deleted automatically by MariaDB when the foreign keys in Event table are deleted.

Since version 7.0, we is using the table Activity intead of Event. Correspondingly, you need to empty the Activity table. 

Use the following command:

```
use seahub_db;
DELETE FROM Activity WHERE to_days(now()) - to_days(timestamp) > 90;

```

The corresponding items in UserActivity will deleted automatically by MariaDB when the foreign keys in Activity table are deleted.

### Login

To clean the login records, login in to MySQL/MariaDB and use the following command:

```
use seahub_db;
DELETE FROM sysadmin_extra_userloginlog WHERE to_days(now()) - to_days(login_date) > 90;

```

### File Access

To clean the file access records, login in to MySQL/MariaDB and use the following command:

```
use seahub_db;

```

### File Update

DELETE FROM FileHistory WHERE to_days(now()) - to_days(timestamp) > 90;

```

### Outdated Library Data

Since version 6.2, we offer command to clear outdated library records in Seahub database,
e.g. records that are not deleted after a library is deleted. This is because users can restore a deleted library, so we can't delete these records at library deleting time.

```
cd <install-path>/seafile-server-latest
./seahub.sh python-env seahub/manage.py clear_invalid_repo_data

```
