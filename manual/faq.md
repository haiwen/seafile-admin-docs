# FAQ

## Setup

### Failed to upload/download file online

* Make sure your firewall for Seafile fileserver is opened.
* Make sure `SERVICE_URL` in ccnet.conf and `FILE_SERVER_ROOT` in seahub_settings.py are set correctly. Furthermore check that you haven't overwritten them using the settings in the Seahub Admin section.
* Use Chrome/Firefox debug mode to find out which address is being used when clicking download button and whether it is correct.

### Seahub/Seafile started correctly, but when visiting the web interface, it shows "Internal Server Error"

It is mostly likely some required Python packages of Seahub is not installed correctly.

You can check the detailed error messages in `/var/log/nginx/seahub.error.log` if you use Nginx.

### Website displays "Page unavailable", what can I do?

* You can check the back trace in Seahub log files (`installation folder/logs/seahub.log`)
* You can also turn on debug mode by adding `DEBUG = True` to `seahub_settings.py` and restarting Seahub with `./seahub.sh restart`, then refresh the page, all the debug infomations will be displayed.

### Failed to send email, what can I do?

Please check logs/seahub.log.

There are some common mistakes:

1. Check whether there are typos in the config (`seahub_settings.py`, e.g. you could have forgotten to add a single quote `EMAIL_HOST_USER = XXX`, which should be `EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'XXX'` or you could have a space at the end of a config line.
2. Your mail server is not available.

## AD (LDAP)

### Can't connect to LDAP server with ldaps

#### Description

Seafile server can't communication with my LDAP server. The ccnet.log shows:

```
[08/05/16 09:47:17] ../common/session.c(398): Accepted a local client
[08/05/16 09:47:17] user-mgr.c(335): ldap_initialize failed: Bad parameter to an ldap routine.
[08/05/16 09:47:17] user-mgr.c(773): Ldap init and bind failed using ‘cn=XXX,dc=XXX,dc=XXX': ‘XXXXXXX' on server 'ldaps://10.XX.XX.XX/'.

```

#### Answer

If you are using pro edition, you can check the LDAP configuration by running a script as described in [useing ldap pro](deploy_pro/using_ldap_pro.md) (search Testing your LDAP Configuration).

If the script can correctly talk to ldap server, it is most likely caused by incompatible of bundled LDAP libraries. You can follow [useing ldap pro](deploy/using_ldap.md) (the end of document) to remove the bundled LDAP libraries.

### How to restrict Seafile access to certain accounts in AD

You can use FILTER field in LDAP configuration in `ccnet.conf`. For example, the following filter restricts the access to Seafile to members of a group.

```
FILTER = memberOf=cn=group,cn=users,DC=x

```

AD also supports subgroups. The following filter restricts the access to Seafile to membersand subgroups of a group.

```
FILTER = memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=cn=group,cn=users,DC=x

```

For more information on the Filter syntax, see <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746475%28VS.85%29.aspx>

## Upgrade

### After upgrading Web UI is broken because CSS files can't be loaded

Please remove the cache and try again, `rm -rf /tmp/seahub_cache/*`. If you configured memecached, restart memcached, then restart Seahub.

If the problem is not fixed, check whether seafile-server-latest point to the correct folder. Then check whether `seafile-server-latest/seahub/media/CACHE` is correctly being generated (it should contain the auto-generated CSS file(s)).

### Avatar pictures vanished after upgrading the server, what can I do?

* You need to check whether the "avatars" symbolic link under seahub/media/ is linking to ../../../seahub-data/avatars. If not, you need to correct the link according to the "minor upgrade" section in [Upgrading-Seafile-Server](deploy/upgrade.md).
* If your avatars link is correct, and avatars are still broken, you may need to refresh Seahub cache using `rm -rf /tmp/seahub_cache/*` or by restarting memcached if being used.

## Server can't start

### Seafile/Seahub can't start after upgrade or any other reasons

Please check whether the old version of Seahub is still running.

Please check whether you use the right user to run or upgrade Seafile. Pay special attention to the following files:

* `seafile-directory/seafile-server-6.0.3/runtime/error.log`
* `seafile-directory/seafile-server-6.0.3/runtime/access.log`
* `seafile-directory/logs/*`

You can run the following command to change fix the permission for the whole directory:

```
chown -R userx:groupx seafiledirectory

```

You can also try remove the cache directory of Seahub

```
rm -rf /tmp/seahub_cache

```

Please also check the permission of `seahub.pid` and `seahub.log`. If Seahub can't write to these files, it will fail to start.

## SeafEvents

### Seafevents can't be started

#### Description

Office files online preview can't work. There is no logs in seafevents.log. From `controller.log`, the seafevent process is being started again and again.

#### Answer

Please check the permission of `seafevent.pid` and `seafevent.log`. If seafevent can't write to these files, it will fail to start.

Another possible reason is that you don't have all the necessary Python dependancies installed. Especially if you enable publishing events to Redis but not installed the Redis Python library.

## GC

### Seafile GC shows errors, FSCK can’t fix them

GC scans the history. But FSCK only scans the current version. You can ignore the error. It is a minor issue.

## Ceph and S3

### Seafile server can't started when using Ceph

#### Description

Seafile server can't started when using Ceph as storage backend. seafile.log is empty. controller.log shows:

```
[10/20/16 12:39:29] seafile-controller.c(568): pid file /opt/seafile/pids/seaf-server.pid does not exist
[10/20/16 12:39:29] seafile-controller.c(588): seaf-server need restart...
[10/20/16 12:39:29] seafile-controller.c(198): starting seaf-server ...

```

#### Answer

This is most likely caused by Ceph library incompatible. If you deploy Seafile on Ubuntu or Debian, make sure you are using the binary built for Ubuntu.

### Virus scan and search index doesn't work with HTTPS S3

The `use_https = true` options in seafile.conf config are working just for regular file operations to S3, but not indexing or AV scanning.

Create ‘/etc/boto.cfg’ and add the following:

```
[boto]
is_secure = True

```

Then the issue can be resolved.

### GC error when removing blocks in Ceph

#### Description

We just did a GC run which came up with errors when deleting blocks. This seems to happen with all blocks/libraries. Below is an example for a single library.

```

```

#### Answer

Your "issue" looks similar to the one discussed here:
<http://lists.ceph.com/pipermail/ceph-users-ceph.com/2015-November/005837.html>

That should be related to the behavior of cache tier in Ceph. You could try to use "rados rm" command to remove that object. If it returns the same error (no such file or directory), it should be the same issue. You should try to copy that object out before removing it, in case you still need it later.
