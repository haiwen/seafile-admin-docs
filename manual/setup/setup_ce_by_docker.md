# Installation of Seafile Server Community Edition with Docker

## System requirements

Please refer [here](./system_requirements.md#seafile-ce) for system requirements about Seafile CE. In general, we recommend that you have at least 2G RAM and a 2-core CPU (> 2GHz).

## Getting started

The following assumptions and conventions are used in the rest of this document:

- `/opt/seafile` is the directory for store Seafile docker compose files. If you decide to put Seafile in a different directory — which you can — adjust all paths accordingly.
- Seafile uses two [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) for persisting data generated in its database and Seafile Docker container. The volumes' [host paths](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes) are `/opt/seafile-mysql` and `/opt/seafile-data`, respectively. It is not recommended to change these paths. If you do, account for it when following these instructions.
- All configuration and log files for Seafile and the webserver Nginx are stored in the volume of the Seafile container.

### Install docker

Use the [official installation guide for your OS to install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Download and modify `.env`

To deploy Seafile with Docker, you have to `.env`, `seafile-server.yml`  and `caddy.yml` in a directory (e.g., `/opt/seafile`):

```bash
mkdir /opt/seafile
cd /opt/seafile

wget -O .env https://manual.seafile.com/13.0/repo/docker/ce/env
wget https://manual.seafile.com/13.0/repo/docker/ce/seafile-server.yml
wget https://manual.seafile.com/13.0/repo/docker/seadoc.yml
wget https://manual.seafile.com/13.0/repo/docker/caddy.yml

nano .env
```

### Start Seafile server

Start Seafile server with the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

!!! warning "ERROR: Named volume "xxx" is used in service "xxx" but no declaration was found in the volumes section"
    You may encounter this problem when your Docker (or docker-compose) version is out of date. You can upgrade or reinstall the Docker service to solve this problem according to the `Docker official documentation`

!!! note
    You must run the above command in the directory with the `.env`. If `.env` file is elsewhere, please run

    ```sh
    docker compose -f /path/to/.env up -d
    ```

!!! success
    After starting the services, you can see the initialization progress by tracing the logs of container `seafile` (i.e., `docker logs seafile -f`)

    ```
    ---------------------------------
    This is your configuration
    ---------------------------------

        server name:            seafile
        server ip/domain:       seafile.example.com

        seafile data dir:       /opt/seafile/seafile-data
        fileserver port:        8082

        database:               create new
        ccnet database:         ccnet_db
        seafile database:       seafile_db
        seahub database:        seahub_db
        database user:          seafile

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    Your seafile server configuration has been finished successfully.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    ``` 
    
    And then you can see the following messages which the Seafile server starts successfully:

    ```
    Starting seafile server, please wait ...
    Seafile server started

    Done.

    Starting seahub at port 8000 ...

    Done.
    ```

    Finially, you can go to `http://seafile.example.com` to use Seafile.

## Seafile directory structure

### Path `/opt/seafile-data`

Placeholder spot for shared volumes. You may elect to store certain persistent information outside of a container, in our case we keep various log files and upload directory outside. This allows you to rebuild containers easily without losing important information.

* /opt/seafile-data/seafile: This is the directory for seafile server configuration and data.
    * /opt/seafile-data/seafile/logs: This is the directory that would contain the log files of seafile server processes. For example, you can find seaf-server logs in `/opt/seafile-data/seafile/logs/seafile.log`.
* /opt/seafile-data/logs: This is the directory for operating system.
    * /opt/seafile-data/logs/var-log: This is the directory that would be mounted as `/var/log` inside the container. `/opt/seafile-data/logs/var-log/nginx` contains the logs of Nginx in the Seafile container.

### Find logs

To monitor container logs (from outside of the container), please use the following commands:

```bash
# if the `.env` file is in current directory:
docker compose logs --follow
# if the `.env` file is elsewhere:
docker compose -f /path/to/.env logs --follow

# you can also specify container name:
docker compose logs seafile --follow
# or, if the `.env` file is elsewhere:
docker compose -f /path/to/.env logs seafile --follow
```

The Seafile logs are under `/shared/logs/seafile` in the docker, or `/opt/seafile-data/logs/seafile` in the server that run the docker.

The system logs are under `/shared/logs/var-log`, or `/opt/seafile-data/logs/var-log` in the server that run the docker.

To monitor all Seafile logs simultaneously (from outside of the container), run

```bash
sudo tail -f $(find /opt/seafile-data/ -type f -name *.log 2>/dev/null)
```

## More configuration options

The config files are under `/opt/seafile-data/seafile/conf`. You can modify the configurations according to [configuration section](../config/README.md)

## Add a new admin

Ensure the container is running, then enter this command:

```bash
docker exec -it seafile /opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest/reset-admin.sh
```

Enter the username and password according to the prompts. You now have a new admin account.

## Backup and recovery

Follow the instructions in [Backup and restore for Seafile Docker](../administration/backup_recovery.md)

## Garbage collection

When files are deleted, the blocks comprising those files are not immediately removed as there may be other files that reference those blocks (due to the magic of deduplication). To remove them, Seafile requires a ['garbage collection'](../administration/seafile_gc.md) process to be run, which detects which blocks no longer used and purges them.


## FAQ

### Seafile service and container maintenance

Q: If I want enter into the Docker container, which command I can use?

A: You can enter into the docker container using the command:

```bash
docker exec -it seafile /bin/bash
```


Q: I forgot the Seafile admin email address/password, how do I create a new admin account?

A: You can create a new admin account by running

```shell
docker exec -it seafile /opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest/reset-admin.sh
```

The Seafile service must be up when running the superuser command.


Q: If, for whatever reason, the installation fails, how do I to start from a clean slate again?

A: Remove the directories /opt/seafile, /opt/seafile-data and /opt/seafile-mysql and start again.


Q: Something goes wrong during the start of the containers. How can I find out more?

A: You can view the docker logs using this command: `docker compose logs -f`.

### About cache

Q: How Seafile use cache?

A: Seafile uses cache to improve performance in many situations. The content includes but is not limited to user session information, avatars, profiles, records from database, etc. From Seafile Docker 13, the ***Redis*** takes the default cache server for supporting the new features (please refer the ***upgradte notes***), which has integrated in Seafile Docker 13 and can be configured directly in environment variables in `.env` (**no additional settings are required by default**)

Q: Is the Redis integrated in Seafile Docker safe? Does it have an access password?

A: Although the Redis integrated by Seafile Docker does not have a password set by default, it can only be accessed through the Docker private network and will not expose the service port externally. Of course, you can also set a password for it if necessary. You can set `REDIS_PASSWORD` in `.env` and remove the following comment markers in `seafile-server.yml` to set the integrated Redis' password:

```yml
services:
    ...
    redis:
    image: ${SEAFILE_REDIS_IMAGE:-redis}
    container_name: seafile-redis
    # remove the following comment markers
    command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - redis-server --requirepass "$${REDIS_PASSWORD:?Variable is not set or empty}"
    networks:
    - seafile-net
    ...
```

Q: For some reason, I still have to use Memcached as my cache server. How can I do this?

A: If you still want to use the ***Memcached*** (is not provided from Seafile Docker 13), just follow the steps below:

- Set `CACHE_PROVIDER` to `memcached` and modify `MEMCACHED_xxx` in `.env`
- Remove the `redis` part and and the `redis` dependency in `seafile` service section in `seafile-server.yml`. 

By the way, you can make changes to the cache server after the service is started (by setting environment variables in `.env`), but the corresponding configuration files will not be updated directly (e.g., `seahub_settings.py`, `seafile.conf` and `seafevents.conf`). To avoid ambiguity, we recommend that you also update these configuration files.
