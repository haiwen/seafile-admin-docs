You can turn golang file-server on by adding following configuration in seafile.conf

```
[fileserver]
use_go_fileserver = true

Potential breaking change in Seafile Pro 8.0.3: You can set the maximum number of files contained in a library that can be synced by the Seafile client. The default is 100000. When you download a repo, Seafile client will request fs id list, and you can control the timeout period of this request through `fs_id_list_request_timeout` configuration, which defaults to 5 minutes. These two options are added to prevent long fs-id-list requests from overloading the server. If you have large libraries on the server, this can cause "internal server error" returned to the client. You have to set a large enough limit for these two options.

```
[fileserver]
max_sync_file_count = 100000
